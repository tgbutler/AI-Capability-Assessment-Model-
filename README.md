# AI-Capability-Assessment-Model-
The comprehension and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is beset with practical as well as ethical problems. This project presents a 5-level AI Capability Assessment Model (AI-CAM) and a related AI Capabilities Matrix (AI-CM) aimed at assisting practitioners in AI comprehension and adoption. 

The AI-CAM is composed of 12 tables, of which 4 are in a reader-friendly format:

- the AI-CAM Level Criteria table, which defines the capability requirements that an organization should fulfil to achieve its AI comprehension and adoption objectives;
- the AI Capability Assessment Model (AI-CAM): Core Areas, which provides guidance on the core areas, including capabilities (i.e., knowledge and skills), required at different stages and levels in AI comprehension and adoption;
- the AI Proficiency Levels, which defines three levels of AI proficiency corresponding to the level of interaction with AI technologies for different types of roles within an organization;
- the AI Capabilities Matrix, which details the individual and team-level capabilities needed to reach each level in organizational AI capability.

The remaining 8 tables contain the information in a coded format.

These 12 AI-CAM tables are presented as separate tabs in the `AI-CAM_2021-03-04.xlsx` file.

Further details on the tables, the development of the model and its motivations can be found in [TBA].
